# Agranari Features

These are some features you can acquire in the Agranari TTRPG. You don’t have classes like in DnD, so in order to get new features and new skills, you have to “buy” them with XP points.

Some features give you trainable stats. These are new stats that you have that you can spend XP to improve. All trainable stats default to 0 unless otherwise stated. If they have a default that is not 0, the stated default is a bonus on top of whatever XP you spend into them.

# Species Features

Some features you can’t just buy. Some are given to you by your species. Some features can be shared between species. The features below are features you can only get from your species or from rare special occasions.

These features often give you a lot more permanent stats than trainable stats. Permanent stats can’t be trained, and are generally fixed unless something specific happens. Permanent stats are usually rolled at the time of character creation. For example, (25 + d35) means roll a 35-sided virtual die and add 25 to the result to get the total. If one of these rolls requires a stat, such as Vision, add only the base Vision and not the Vision Variance to the roll.

## Darkvision

Permanent Stats

-   Darkvision Penetration (Vision + d50)
-   Darkvision Range (25 + d35 m)
-   Light Resistance (10 + d90)

You can see in the dark. Darkvision Penetration increases the darkness threshold at which you can still see. Darkvision Range increases how far out you can see in the dark. Light Resistance decreases the amount of Light damage you take when suddenly transitioning from dark to light areas.

# aDirada’s Lie

Permanent Stats

-   Lie Power (5 + d20)
-   Max Hoof Length (10 + d90 cm)
-   Hoof Lifespan (24 + d300 hrs)
-   Hoof Growth Rate (d100/100 cm/f) !!REWORK THIS TO BE POSITIVELY FRAMED!!
-   Lie Speed (0 + d10 f/s)
-   Lie Range (0 + d100 m)

Is reality not how you like it? Then you can change it! You can make almost any modification you like to almost anything. When you modify an object with this ability, it’s called “lying on that object”. Your ability to lie on an object is increased with your Lie Power. When you lie, your hoof grows, based on your Hoof Growth Rate. You can then clip that hoof, and that clipping holds your lie together. As long as that hoof clipping remains intact, the lie does as well. However, hoof clippings only live as long as your Hoof Lifespan. At that point, it dissolves on its own and the lie reverts back to the way it was. Hooves can also be broken early to end the lie early. Note that hooves can be etched without breaking, and in certain circumstances, can be put back together to reinstate the lie.

The Lie Range is how close the target must be to be the target of the lie. This effects the telling of the lie, but does not effect the lie once it has completed. The Lie Speed is how many fibs per second you can do. The Max Hoof Length is how long a hoof clipping can get before breaking off on its own.

Each lie is made up of a series of fibs. Fibs are tiny changes that lead up to the major change of the lie. Each spell requires a certain amount of fibs to be complete. When a lie has all its fibs, it is complete.

Most deers have two hoof hands, each with their own lying middle hoof. This means that they can lie with their left hoof or their right hoof.

## Heart Fire

Permanent Stats

-   Fire Power (5 + d20)
-   Fire Self Damage Factor (d150/100 + 0.5)

Trainable Stats

-   Max Fire Points (default: Age \* 2)
-   Fire Point Cost Reduction
-   Fire Will Factor (default: 1)
-   Fire Point Depletion XP Gain (default: 1)
-   Ignite Range (default: 0m)

Whenever you make a check, you can spend Fire Points to increase that check’s value by the amount of Fire Points spent times your Fire Will Factor. Then you take damage equal to the amount of Fire Points spent times your Fire Self Damage Factor.

Whenever you run out of Fire Points, you gain XP to put into your Max Fire Points stats. The amount of XP you gain for that stat is equal to your Fire Point Depletion XP Gain stat.

Ignite Range is essentially the range of your Heart Fire spells. At 0 range, you need to be touching the target in question for the spell to take effect.

You regain all fire points at the end of a night’s sleep.

# Trainable Features

Some features you can learn over time. The following features can be bought with XP points, largely Irregardless of your species.

These features often have requirements that must be met in order to purchase. When a requirement mentions a stat, its variance stat also counts towards it. For example, if a feature requires 50+ Strength, and you have 25 base Strength and 30 Strength Variance, you have met the requirements for purchasing the stats.

If the requirement says 50+ in a specific type of weapon, that weapon’s Accuracy, Accuracy Variance, and Damage Variance must add up to the requirement. You cannot combine multiple weapons of the same type to meet this requirement; you must have at least 1 weapon of that type that meets the requirement.

## Hard Swinger

100 XP

Requires

-   50+ Strength
-   50+ in a Bludgeoning weapon

Whenever you make a melee attack with a Bludgeoning weapon, you may make a Strength check and add its value to your Damage value. If you do, this attack’s recovery time cost increases by 1.

## Sharpshooter

100 XP

Requires

-   50+ in a Sense
-   50+ in a ranged weapon

Climb Speed Variance determines what to roll for when you want to climb further in a second. Climbing Proficiency is how well you can climb, and allows you to climb surfaces that are harder to climb.

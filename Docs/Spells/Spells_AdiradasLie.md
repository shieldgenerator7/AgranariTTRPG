## Carnivorate

Bend Bone

Time cost: 5 min (3 sec/point)

The target grows long sharp teeth and gains the Bite action. The target gains additional damage on their bite attack, equal to your Carnivorate Damage stat.

If they already have sharp teeth, they grow more teeth and/or the ones they already have grow longer.

Stats:

-   Carnivorate Damage: 1 + d1
-   Carnivorate Ease: 0

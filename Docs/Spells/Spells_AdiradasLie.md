## Change Species

Difficulty: 50

Requirements: You must have seen the species at least once.

You become a member of another Agranari species. You become a regular-proportioned member of that species with about your same size. Your fur pattern and overall physique stays the same as much as possible.

You gain the stats of your new form, higher or lower, and you gain their physical abilities. However, you don’t automatically adjust to your new form. If you’re not familiar with your new form, you need time to adjust and get experience in it before you can use it to its full effectiveness.

If your new form has a Blemish, make a History check and an Arcana check. If you pass both, your new Blemish is functional and you gain the species ability that comes with the Blemish.

When you cast this spell, you can choose whether or not to bend your Bending Hoof too. If you do bend your Bending Hoof, the hoof clipping immediately falls off.

## Copy Appearance

Difficulty: 25

Change your appearance to mimic that of another individual, who is the same species as you. You must have seen them at least once. Make a History ability check, the result of which determines how successful you are at mimicking them. If you are looking at them while casting the spell, you get Advantage x3 on this check.

Spell Bend

-   Copy Species (Difficulty +75): You may mimic an individual who is a different species than you. This follows the transformation rules outlined in the “Change Species” spell.
-   Copy Blemish (Difficulty +50): Make a History and Arcana check. If you pass both, you may copy their Blemish stats for your new form. If you are looking at them while casting the spell, you get Advantage x3 on this History check.

# Adirada’s Lie

Adirada-Do, the Deer Goddess of Truth and Nature, was a normal deer who was granted the extraordinary ability to bend reality. She passed on her gift to her descendants, who now know it as Adirada’s Lie.

Those who have the power of Adirada’s Lie have a blemish on their hoof hands: the middle hoof finger is disproportionately bigger than the other hoof fingers. This is the source of their power.

# Magic System

How this magic system works.

## Spell Ease

Every spell has a stat called “[Spell Name] Ease” specifically for it. The more you cast a spell, the easier it is to cast, and the less time it takes to cast. You can put XP into this ease stat for each spell to decrease its time cost.

## Parent Spells

Some spells have a parent spell. A spell’s parent spell is a spell that is a prerequisite for being able to cast this spell, as it is usually a more complex version of the parent spell. The spell will list the parent spell as a requirement to be able to cast this spell.

Additionally, having ease in the parent spell makes it easier to cast the spell. Every spell that has a parent spell has an additional stat (not listed), called “[Spell Name] Parent Ease Factor”. This stat starts at 0, but you can spend XP to increase it. When calculating the time cost of a spell, multiply the parent spell’s ease with this ease factor stat, and add the result to your total ease for this casting.

If the parent spell also has a parent spell, you can include that parent’s spell ease as well, using the parent spell’s parent ease factor stat. And thusly up the chain.

Agranari TTRPG Guide for D&D Players

This document goes into detail about specific changes from D&D.

# General

## Dice can be any number

In D&D, you have a d20, and some other dice like d4 and d6. You use the d20 most often.

However in this game, dice can be any number. You could roll a 1d37 or a 1d18. It’s all up to you and your DM.

## There are no character levels

Well there are, but it’s cosmetic only. A level is just a number to indicate a character’s power level. You don’t ever really “level up” and you gain features and power without “gaining a level”.

## XP is used to increase skills

When you gain XP, you spend it on certain skills, like Accuracy to increase your chance of hitting with your weapon, Dodge to increase your chance of dodging attacks, and lots of other things, like Smell to increase your chance of sensing a creature by scent alone.

## You gain XP even out of combat

Every day you can practice your skills, even if it’s not combat related. Each day you practice skills, you gain a little XP to spend as you choose on skills.

## The Units are meters

In D&D, every square is 5ft. In this game, each square is 1 meter. Likewise, speed is measured in meters per second, instead of D&D’s feet per round (6 seconds).

## Willpower can be used to succeed

In D&D, if you don’t like the outcome of a roll, you can use things like the Lucky feat, Halfling Lucky, or Inspiration.

In this game, you have a resource called Willpower. When you don’t like the outcome of a roll, you can spend Willpower to increase the result of that roll, potentially changing the outcome. You can spend as many willpower points as you want on a single roll. You can spend it on any number of rolls on any given day. At the very least, you regain all willpower at the start of each day.

The amount you spend is multiplied by your Willpower Factor, which increases how much bonus your willpower gives to your roll.

## Character stats are different

In D&D, each character has 6 ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma. In this game, characters have waaay more stats. Some of them correspond to the D&D ability scores quite nicely, while others are way different.

Strength is measured in pounds, and is an indicator of how much your character can lift.

Dodge is like D&D Dexterity, in a way. It determines how likely you are to dodge an attack.

Constitution is how much health your character can lose without going unconscious. Works more like death saves in D&D.

Intelligence isn’t really a stat in this game (at least not yet). Comparable stats include Search.

Wisdom in D&D is used for many things, mostly perception. In this game, characters have a separate stat for each sense they have (sight, hearing, smell, etc).

There is no Charisma stat.

# Combat

## Characters die at 0

In D&D, when your character’s hit points reach 0, they go unconscious, but don’t immediately die. In this game, when you character’s health reaches 0, they die. However, they usually go unconscious way before that. How much damage they can take without going unconscious is determined by their Constitution stat.

## Defenders dodge with a roll

There’s no Armor Class (AC) like in D&D. When you get attacked, you make a Dodge roll. If the attack rolls higher than your dodge roll, you get hit. Otherwise, you dodge.

## Crits require double accuracy

In D&D, you crit when you roll a 20 on a d20 attack roll. In this game, you crit when your Accuracy roll is at least 2 times the defender’s Dodge roll.

## No Opportunity Attacks

Attacks of Opportunity in D&D discourage people from moving around, and make running away almost impossible. This game does not have attacks of opportunity. Some creatures might have developed it as a skill, but most aren’t able to just do it.

## AoE Attacks

If you’re surrounded or having trouble hitting, you can do an Area of Effect (AoE) attack. Declare which squares you’re hitting. On your next turn, you roll for damage, and every square takes that damage. This damage is undodgable, and is split evenly among the squares, no matter how many enemies are in those squares. You are allowed to move while charging the AoE attack.

## Characters can be wounded

In D&D, there’s no official concept of being wounded, but sometimes people homebrew it in. In this game, when a character takes a large amount of damage all at once, they become wounded, and suffer a permanent stat debuff.

Wounds heal over time, and you can spend XP on a wound to help it heal faster, and decrease the amount of the stat debuff. You can even overspend on it, having a net gain in that stat. However, wounds never fully go away, and can always be reopened.

Most wounds are a simple stat debuff, but some wounds can be so detrimental as to represent the loss of a limb. Lost limbs don’t grow back. You can regain the stat debuffs from these serious wounds, but you don’t regrow the limb. This means your character’s action economy is forever stunted.

To decrease your chance of getting a wound, increase your Durability.

## Characters can be winced

In D&D, creatures usually only get stunned by rare effects, such as Stunning Strike or certain spells. In this game, every attack has a chance to stun.

When you hit with an attack, your target takes damage and the pain from the damage has a chance to stun them. If they become stunned, they wince in pain from the attack. They stop all channels and can’t take actions or move for a short while. This is comparable to making Constitution saving throws for concentration I D&D.

To decrease your chance of getting winced, increase your Pain Tolerance.

# Roleplay

## There’s no persuasion rolls

Sometimes D&D DMs will have you “roll for persuasion”. There’s no such thing in this game. There’s no rolls that “mind control” other players or NPCs, unless an actual magic item is involved. Whether or not the persuasion actual works is up to the DM, or the player of the character.
